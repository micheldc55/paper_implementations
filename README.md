# Paper Implementations

Python repository for implementing papers that interest me, either from ML, DL, LLMs or statistics

## Setup using `uv`

First, install `uv` if you haven't already. More on the installation [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). This repository uses version `0.7.3` for dependency management.

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Then, install the dependencies.

```bash
uv sync
```

## Note on Python version

This repository uses Python `3.11.x`. `uv` will look for this version by default, make sure you have it installed.
